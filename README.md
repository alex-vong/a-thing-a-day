# A-Thing-A-Day

Inspired by Perpertual Education's ['Make a Thing a Day Challenge]('https://perpetual.education/exercises/thing-a-day/').

##Goals

Will be using Affinity Designer for this challenge. With each thing I hope to beter my skills on AD and get better at using it's tools. I decided to go with a **skull** theme and try this for **30 straight days**.
